# Kinect Research Porject

This is a 3D space reconstruction system based on active infrared stereo cameras. With multiple cameras support, this configuration is expected to increase fidelity and space coverage. In this demo code, we use two Microsoft Kinect to acquire the depth of video stream. more then two cameras may need to modify code and hardware configuration.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The software you need before use this code

* libfreenect - Detail setup instructoin in [here](https://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) - 0.8.9 or later
* Xcode - 7.0 or later



### Installing

The "installation" is easy - simply add the contents in the "myApp" directory
in this package to a "myApp" directory (ofxroot/apps/myApps) of openFrameworks is installed 



## Running the code

To run the demo, a example app can be found in the "bin" folder. Compiling the code is also easy, simply open the .xcodeproj with Xcode and press compile play button.

## Built With

* [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) - The C++ framework
* [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) - 3rd pary driver for Kinect
* Xcode - Development Environment
